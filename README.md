Having previously gotten heavily involved with [Amazon Alexa](http://github.com/mramshaw/Alexa-Stuff), it seemed
to be time to take a good look at __Google Assistant__.

## Software versus Hardware

__Google Assistant__ is the software part of Google's voice offerings while __Google Home__ devices are
(one of) the hardware components.

## Devices

In addition to the Google Home and other Google devices, Google Assistant is available on Android devices
(including [Wear OS](http://wearos.google.com) devices such as smartwatches) and also iOS devices.

## Installation

To enable Google Assistant on your Android phone, navigate to the Google Play store and install it.

Here is the link:

## Voices

Internally, Google Assistant has several voices available. These are colour-coded, with names like "Red"
and "Purple". Additionally, there are voices with names that subtly hint at their origins - these have
names like "British Racing Green" and "Sydney Harbour Blue".

## Wake Word

To let Google know you want to invoke a Google Action, start with:

    "Hey Google"

As in:

    "Hey Google, Talk to Find the blood"

Here __Find the blood__ is the action to be invoked, and __Hey Google__ is what is known as a ___Wake Word___.

#### Smartwatches

With a [Wear OS](http://wearos.google.com) device, either say "Ok Google" or press and hold the power button to get started.

## Google Actions

Individual components for Google Assistant are called ___Actions___ (these are what AWS Alexa calls ___Skills___).

To see available Google Actions, refer to:

    http://assistant.google.com/explore

Note that certain actions may not be available in all languages or all regions.

## Certification

While Alexa offers _beta testing_, Google Assistant offers _alpha testing_ __and__ _beta testing_.

Unlike Alexa, Google Assistant will increment a version number as each successive Google Action is certified.

## To Do
